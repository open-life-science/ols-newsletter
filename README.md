# 📬 OLS Monthly Newsletter Repository

Welcome! This is where we coordinate, draft, and co-create each issue of our community newsletter.

We welcome contributions from across the OLS team and broader community — whether you’d like to share a blog post, event, shout-out, or project update.

## 🛠️ How This Works

### 1. Monthly Planning Issues

Each month, an issue titled `📬 [Month Year] Newsletter Planning` is automatically created.  
Use it to:
- Draft that month’s newsletter collaboratively
- Track submissions (linked from separate content issues)
- Coordinate review and approval timelines

➡️ See the [Issues tab](../../issues) to join in!

### 2. Submitting Content

Got something to share?  
Open a new issue using the `Submit Newsletter Content` template to add:
- Blog posts
- Events
- Opportunities
- Project/program updates
- Shout-outs
- Reflections, zines, photos, etc.

You can also drop ideas in the Slack `#newsletter` channel or email us at [team@we-are-ols.org](mailto:team@we-are-ols.org).

## 🗓️ Deadlines

- **Content submissions:** By the last day of the month (e.g. July 31 for the August issue)
- **Final draft + review:** 3 days before scheduled send
- **Newsletter publish day:** The last Friday of each month
